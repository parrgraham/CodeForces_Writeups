Problem Statement

Given a lowercase Latin character (letter), check if it appears in the string "codeforces".
Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 26) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a character c — a single lowercase Latin character (letter).
Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if c satisfies the condition, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).
Constraints

    The input character c is a lowercase Latin character.

    The output answer is case-insensitive.
